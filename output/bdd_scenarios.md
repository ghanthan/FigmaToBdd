# Sign Up Feature

@ui @signup
Feature: Sign Up
  As a new user
  I want to sign up for the application
  So that I can access its features and services

  Background:
    Given I am on the Sign Up page

  @form
  Scenario Outline: Sign Up with Valid Credentials
    When I enter my full name "<name>"
    And I enter my email address "<email>"
    And I enter my password "<password>"
    And I click on the Sign Up button
    Then I should be successfully signed up
    And I should be redirected to the home page

    Examples:
      | name         | email                   | password |
      | John Doe     | john.doe@example.com    | Passw0rd |
      | Jane Smith   | janesmith@company.com   | Secur3P@ |
      | Michael Wong | michael.wong@gmail.com  | Qwerty12 |

  @validation
  Scenario Outline: Sign Up with Invalid Credentials
    When I enter my full name "<name>"
    And I enter an invalid email address "<email>"
    And I enter a weak password "<password>"
    And I click on the Sign Up button
    Then I should see an error message for "<field>"

    Examples:
      | name       | email            | password | field    |
      | Bob        | bob@invalid      | pass     | email    |
      | Alice      | alice@example    | 123      | password |
      |            | jane@company.com | Secur3P@ | name     |

  @social
  Scenario: Sign Up with Social Media Accounts
    When I click on the Facebook button
    Then I should be prompted to sign in with my Facebook account
    When I click on the Google button
    Then I should be prompted to sign in with my Google account

  @navigation
  Scenario: Navigate to Login Page
    When I click on the "Already have an account? Login" link
    Then I should be redirected to the Login page

  @visual
  Scenario: Visual Elements on Sign Up Page
    Then I should see the "Sign Up" heading
    And I should see the "Full name" label
    And I should see the "E-mail" label
    And I should see the "Password" label
    And I should see the password strength indicator
    And I should see the "SIGN UP" button
    And I should see the "Sign up with" section
    And I should see the Facebook and Google buttons

# User Journey

@journey
Feature: User Journey
  As a user
  I want to perform various actions
  So that I can accomplish my goals

  Background:
    Given I am on the home page

  @primary
  Scenario: Primary User Flow
    When I click on the "Sign Up" link
    Then I should be redirected to the Sign Up page
    When I sign up with valid credentials
    Then I should be successfully signed up
    And I should be able to access the application's features

  @secondary
  Scenario: Secondary User Flow
    Given I am already signed up
    When I click on the "Login" link
    Then I should be redirected to the Login page
    When I enter my valid credentials
    And I click on the "Login" button
    Then I should be successfully logged in
    And I should be able to access the application's features

  @error
  Scenario: Error Scenario
    When I click on a broken link
    Then I should see an error message
    And I should be able to navigate back to the home page

  @edge
  Scenario Outline: Edge Cases
    When I enter an extremely long "<input>" value
    Then the input field should handle the input gracefully

    Examples:
      | input |
      | name  |
      | email |

# Functional Requirements

@functional
Feature: Functional Requirements
  As a user
  I want to perform various actions
  So that I can accomplish my goals

  @form-validation
  Scenario Outline: Form Validation
    When I enter an invalid "<field>" value
    Then I should see an error message for the "<field>" field

    Examples:
      | field    |
      | name     |
      | email    |
      | password |

  @data-entry
  Scenario: Data Entry
    When I enter valid data in all required fields
    Then the data should be saved successfully

  @search
  Scenario Outline: Search Functionality
    Given I am on the search page
    When I enter a "<query>" in the search field
    And I click on the search button
    Then I should see relevant search results

    Examples:
      | query     |
      | products  |
      | services  |
      | tutorials |

  @filter-sort
  Scenario: Filter and Sorting
    Given I am on the product listing page
    When I apply a filter for a specific category
    Then I should see only products from that category
    When I sort the products by price in descending order
    Then the products should be sorted correctly
```

This BDD document covers various aspects of the Sign Up feature, user journeys, and functional requirements based on the provided Figma design data. It includes scenarios for signing up with valid and invalid credentials, social media sign-up, navigation, visual elements, primary and secondary user flows, error scenarios, edge cases, form validations, data entry, search functionality, and filtering and sorting.

The scenarios are written in Gherkin format, with feature descriptions, background steps (where applicable), scenario outlines with examples, and Given-When-Then steps. Tags are used for categorization, making it easier to organize and run specific sets of scenarios.

The scenarios are designed to be testable, measurable, clear, and understandable. They aim to cover the essential aspects of the application while avoiding redundancy. The scenarios are aligned with user experience goals and can be used as a basis for test automation or manual testing efforts.

## Design Data Reference

The following design elements were analyzed to generate these scenarios:

### Pages and Frames

#### Page 1
- **Sign Up:** FRAME

#### Page 2

### Key UI Elements
- **Sign Up** (TEXT)
- **$ 1679.30** (TEXT)
- **Already have an account? Login** (TEXT)

## Usage Instructions

1. Import these scenarios into your preferred BDD testing framework
2. Implement step definitions for each Given/When/Then step
3. Configure your test environment to match the design specifications
4. Execute the scenarios as part of your testing pipeline

## Notes

- These scenarios are generated based on UI design analysis
- Additional business logic scenarios may need to be added manually
- Verify that all interactive elements have corresponding test steps
- Update scenarios as the design evolves
